| Bias | Systematic skew in model outputs due to imbalances in training data. An ongoing challenge with generative AI. |
| Context | External information passed into a generative model (as tokens) when making a prediction. |
| Diffusion Models | Generative models that create images via iteratively denoising random noise using a neural net. |
| Embedding | Representing discrete tokens like words as continuous vector representations based on context. |
| Parametric Knowledge | The knowledge encoded in the parameters of a generative model and frozen in time. These form the basis for generating new content based on patterns learned during training. |
| Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) | Combining a vector DB retrieval module to access non-parametric knowledge (e.g. recent news). |
| Vector DB | Database of vector representations of content used along with a generative model. Allows retrieving relevant information. |
