# Generative AI Notes 

Notes providing a high-level synthesis of key generative AI concepts, applications, limitations, and more based on my learnings and research.

Some highlights of the repository:

- `/developer` - Useful tools and resources specifically for AI Engineers
- `/products` - A curated set of best-in-class products, services and applications that leverage generative AI models.
- `/resources` - Curated papers, blogs, tools, and tutorials on generative AI.
- `/examples` - Mini-projects as Jupyter notebooks to showcase uses of models like GPT-4, Stable Diffusion, etc.

This is a work in progress, so please feel free to open issues or PRs if you have any feedback! The main goal is to make generative AI more accessible.
