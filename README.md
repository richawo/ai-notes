# Generative AI Notes 

Notes providing a high-level synthesis of key generative AI concepts, applications, limitations, and more based on my learnings. This repo is predominantly targeted at AI engineers and those interested in the field, but there are benefits for everyone.

As an aspiring AI engineer, generative models represent the future of AI. Although research papers and textbooks provide formal knowledge, there is also value in informal notes from a practitioner's perspective. 

My goal is that these notes provide a high-level synthesis of key generative AI concepts, applications, limitations, and more based on my learnings. Over time, I plan to expand the repository into a valuable community resource for anyone learning about generative AI.

Some highlights of the repository:

- `/notes` - My evolving notes on the basics of generative AI, key models like GPT-4 and Stable Diffusion, applications, limitations, etc.
- `/resources` - Curated papers, blogs, tools, and tutorials on generative AI.
- `/mini-projects` - Mini-projects as Jupyter notebooks to showcase uses of models like GPT-4, Stable Diffusion, etc.

This is a work in progress, so please feel free to open issues or PRs if you have any feedback! The main goal is to make generative AI more accessible.
