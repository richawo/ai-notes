       "{'text': \" Hey guys, the best websites always have the most subtle animations and one of them that you see really often is animated SVG parts and the easiest way to do that is actually with Frame On Motion. Let me show you how. So I've got this simple Next.js project and first thing we're going to do is install Frame On Motion. Now I've got extra stuff in the project to make it beautiful but if we add in the SVG as you can see it's nice and static. Now animating this is simple. First import motion from Frame On Motion. Then we find the path tag and convert that to motions or path. So what we do is set the initial path length to be 0 and the animate path length to be 1 and we can then set the transition duration to be 0.5 and if we reload our webpage we'll see it's a working animation. Amazing. Guys, if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up, if you want to see more please subscribe and if you have any thoughts or questions give it in the comments below. Cheers.\",\n",
